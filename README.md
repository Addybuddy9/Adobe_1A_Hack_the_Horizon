# PDF Outline Extraction System

This project delivers a robust, high-performance solution for extracting structured outlines from PDF documents. Developed for the Adobe India Hackathon 2025 (Challenge 1a), the system translates unstructured PDFs into clear, organized JSON representations of their logical structure.

## Key Features

- **Rapid Processing:** Extracts a hierarchical outline from a 50-page PDF in under 10 seconds.
- **Versatile Compatibility:** Handles a wide range of PDFs, including books, technical reports, and multi-language forms.
- **Extensive Language Support:** Recognizes and processes major global scripts (including CJK, Arabic, Hebrew, and Cyrillic).
- **Autonomous Structure Detection:** Accurately identifies document outlines, even if an explicit table of contents is absent.
- **Batch Processing:** Supports the efficient processing of multiple documents in a single run.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Operates effectively on standard hardware (up to 8 CPUs, 16GB RAM).
- **Flexible Deployment:** Usable via Docker (recommended) or direct Python installation. Compatible with Python 3.9+.

## Installation and Usage

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t pdf-processor .
   ```
2. Run the container with input and output directories:
   ```sh
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/input:/app/input:ro -v $(pwd)/output:/app/output --network none pdf-processor
   ```

### Direct Python Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.9 or newer is installed.
2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Execute the main processor:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Project Architecture

- **pdf_extractor.py:** Core PDF parsing and processing logic.
- **text_processor.py:** Text cleaning and pre-processing.
- **heading_classifier.py:** Heading detection through analysis of text attributes.
- **outline_hierarchy.py:** Construction of the hierarchical outline.
- **cache_manager.py:** Optimizes repeated runs by caching results.
- **config.py:** Centralized configuration management.

## Output

For every PDF, the system generates a JSON file containing:
- Document title
- An array of outline entries, each with heading level (H1, H2, etc.), text, and corresponding page number.

### Sample Output

```json
{
  "title": "Sample Book",
  "outline": [
    {
      "level": "H1",
      "title": "Introduction",
      "page": 1
    }
    // More entries...
  ]
}
```

## Advantages

- Robust handling of complex or malformed PDFs.
- High throughput; supports parallel batch processing.
- Minimal, secure dependencies (mainly PyMuPDF and standard libraries).
- Advanced support for multilingual documents, broadening real-world applicability.
